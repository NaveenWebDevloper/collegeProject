                    Greetings from MallaReddy Engineering College and Management Sciences.
                    
                    Institute of Engineering and Technology nurtures and grows young people who pass through its doors and corridors. We, faculty and staff of MREM are committed to fulfill dreams and aspirations of young students who are joining the Institute to become Engineers. We believe Engineers are makers of history. The ideal engineer is a composite ……He is not a scientist, he is not a mathematician, he is not a sociologist or a writer; but he may use the knowledge and techniques of any or all of these disciplines in solving engineering problems for the benefits of society.
                    
                    We provide a system of education where by a ‘state of the art technology’ would support a much wider array of content from a worldwide perspective that would take the children of today through such strategically planned experiences, that were drawn from any part of the world and measured up qualitatively as per world standards to prepare world citizens of tomorrow.
                    
                    As Principal my role is to foster an exciting and invigorating learning environment, where students are at the forefront of teaching and learning. Our dedicated staff work and learn together in collegiate teams to maximize student’s potential by implementing highly effective teaching strategies and student support systems. Parents and Care givers are valued partners and are encouraged to be actively involved in the learning of their children.
                    
                    “We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future” And as the cliché goes, last but not the least, I expect all my young MREMians to focus on their cherished goals and strive hard to accomplish them transcending mediocrity and procrastination. I wish you a very happy and academically highly rewarding student life in MREM and hope that you will be your good deeds enhance the pride and prestige of this institution.
                    
                    Warm Regards</p>
